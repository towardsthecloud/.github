Towards the Cloud is an AWS Cloud Consultancy specialized in shipping well-architected, resilient, and cost-optimized AWS solutions designed to scale using Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK) for B2B startups, Fintechs, and growing businesses.

### [About us](https://towardsthecloud.com/about)

After years as a Principal Cloud Consultant, I saw a recurring pattern: while AWS promised simplicity, businesses got bogged down by complex account structures, security risks, and escalating costs. This caused a lot of B2B startups and growing businesses to struggle with overwhelming configuration options, time-consuming compliance requirements, and diverting valuable developer talent away from core product development.

Without specialized AWS expertise, you risk security vulnerabilities, mounting technical debt, and delayed time-to-market. All while your competitors race ahead.

Traditional AWS consultancies only compound this problem. They're incentivized to bill by the hour, extending projects indefinitely rather than focusing on your business outcomes.

In 2023, I founded Towards the Cloud to take the **opposite approach**. We offer a fixed-price subscription model that delivers an enterprise-grade AWS Landing Zone built entirely in AWS CDK coupled with a support and consultacy foundation that grows with your business needs.

**Here's how we take out the complexity, speed up your development and secure your infrastructure:**

### We deploy a [Secure and Compliant Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone)
- Multi-account architecture with proper security boundaries
  - **Achieves a 100% score on the industry-standard [CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html)**
  - **Achieves a 96% rating on AWS's own [foundational security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html)**
- Setup entirely using AWS CDK (Infrastructure as Code)
- Budget monitoring and notifications across all accounts
- Deploy changes quickly through GitHub Actions
- We're continuously adding new features as listed on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/towardsthecloud/aws-cdk-landing-zone-roadmap)

### We upskill and accelerate your Developers
- They gain access to our library of ready-to-use, security-hardened AWS CDK components
- They receive guidance on how to utilize AWS best practices for your architecture so you avoid technical debt later on

### We monitor and maintain the multi-account setup & provide ongoing support
- Gain new Landing Zone features once they're released and get free maintenance and security updates
- Get priority support through Slack/Teams whenever you need assistance with infrastructure challenges
- We proactively do quarterly [security](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review) and [cost optimization](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) assessments to verify AWS account compliance and provide advice to reduce your AWS bill

### What This Means For Your Business
- **30% Lower TCO**: Cut your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by up to 30% through right-sized resources and architectural optimization while eliminating the $150K+ annual cost of a specialized AWS hire
- **Close Enterprise Deals Faster**: Win enterprise clients with SOC2 compliance ready in weeks instead of months - our clients report 50% faster sales cycles with security-conscious customers
- **Unleash Your Development Team**: Redirect up to 30% of engineering time from infrastructure back to revenue-generating product features with our pre-built, compliant components
- **Scale Without Infrastructure Headaches**: Grow from startup to enterprise without ever rebuilding your foundation - our architecture scales seamlessly from your first customer to your millionth

We deliver all of this as a [simple subscription service](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing). No large upfront costs, no lock-in. You'll essentially get a solid and secure landing zone foundation + a decade of AWS expertise without having to hire a full-time Cloud Engineer.
