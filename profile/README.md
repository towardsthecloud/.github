## About us

[Towards the Cloud](https://towardsthecloud.com/about) is an AWS Cloud Consultancy delivering well-architected, resilient AWS solutions using Infrastructure as Code for B2B startups and growing businesses.

## How we help businesses succeed on AWS Cloud

AWS promises simplicity but delivers complexity. Businesses struggle with security risks and compliance requirements that divert developers from core product work.

Without AWS expertise, you face vulnerabilities, technical debt, and market delays while competitors race ahead.

Traditional consultancies worsen this by prioritizing billable hours over outcomes.

Our approach eliminates AWS complexity, accelerates development, and secures infrastructure by:

### Deploying a [Secure Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone)
- Multi-account architecture with strict security boundaries
  - **100% score** on [CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html)
  - **96% rating** on [AWS foundational security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html)
- Full AWS CDK implementation (Infrastructure as Code)
- Cross-account budget monitoring and alerts
- Rapid deployments via GitHub Actions
- Continuous feature additions per our [Roadmap](https://github.com/towardsthecloud/aws-cdk-landing-zone-roadmap)

### Upskilling and accelerating your developers
- They get access to our production-ready, security-hardened AWS CDK components
- They receive AWS best practices guidance to prevent technical debt

### Providing support and maintenance
- Landing Zone gets updates and security patches
- Priority Slack/Teams support for infrastructure challenges
- Quarterly [security](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review) and [cost optimization](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) assessments to stay compliant and reduce AWS costs

## What This Means For Your Business
- **30% Lower TCO**: Cut Total Cost by 40% through right-sized resources while eliminating the $150K+ cost of a specialized AWS hire.
- **Accelerate Development**: Redirect 30% of engineering time from infrastructure to revenue-generating features with pre-built, compliant CDK components.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Prevent costly breaches with continuously monitored infrastructure and quarterly security assessments that standard AWS implementations lack.

All of this is included in a [subscription service](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing). No large upfront costs, no lock-in.
