> ### [Our Story](https://towardsthecloud.com/about)
>
> After years as a Principal Cloud Consultant, I saw a recurring pattern: while AWS promised simplicity, businesses got bogged down by complex account structures, security risks, and escalating costs.
>
> In 2023, I founded Towards the Cloud with a clear mission: to provide an enterprise-grade AWS foundation that just works. Our Landing Zone solution gives you a solid, compliant foundation from day one, allowing you to focus on building great products while we handle the complex infrastructure beneath.
>
> üèóÔ∏è **Unlike traditional consultancies that just provide infrastructure, what sets us apart is that we deliver:**
>
> * A [production-ready AWS Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone) that grows with your business
> * Access to a library of ready-to-use AWS CDK patterns to accelerate your developers
> * Access to a [decade of Cloud Engineering experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannysteenman/) to help you design, build and deploy Cloud architectures, at a fraction of the cost of a full-time Cloud Engineer
