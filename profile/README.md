## AWS Complexity Compounds Faster Than You Think

AWS is easy to start with, but without proper guardrails and Infrastructure as Code, complexity compounds monthly. The longer you wait, the more expensive and risky the fix becomes.

**You're experiencing:**
- **Rising AWS bills** — inefficient architectures costing 40-60% more than necessary
- **Lost visibility** — security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps you don't know about yet
- **Team bottlenecks** — engineers stuck firefighting infrastructure instead of shipping product

**Traditional consultancies leave you with infrastructure you can't maintain. We provide ongoing managed services so you understand and control your AWS environment.**

## How Our Managed Service Works

We implement security guardrails and Infrastructure as Code best practices at setup, then provide ongoing optimization and support so you stay in control as you scale.

**What you get:**

- ✅ **[Compliant multi-account Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone)** — Start 100% [CIS benchmark compliant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html) with built-in security guardrails, SSO, and AWS CDK ([see features](https://github.com/towardsthecloud/aws-cdk-landing-zone-roadmap?tab=readme-ov-file#features))
- ✅ **Pre-built secure CDK components** — Use our production-ready infrastructure patterns instead of building from scratch
