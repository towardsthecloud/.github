## The Problem: AWS Complexity Builds Faster Than You Realize

AWS is easy to get started with, but without proper security guardrails and Infrastructure as Code best practices, it becomes complex fast. What starts as a simple deployment quickly spirals into a mess that's costing you in ways you might not even realize.

**Here's what's actually happening over time:**
- 🔥 **Mounting AWS bills** from inefficient architectures that could cost 40-60% less with proper optimization
- ⚠️ **Lose control and visibility** over your infrastructure resulting in unnneccary risks and chance of exposing vulnerabilties that might risk your customer's data.
- 😤 **Developers burnout** from spending time on operations instead of building out your product

**Meanwhile, traditional AWS consultancies make it worse** by prioritizing billable hours over your success, then disappearing after setup.
