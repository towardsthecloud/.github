## About us

[Towards the Cloud](https://towardsthecloud.com/about) is an AWS Cloud Consultancy delivering well-architected, resilient AWS solutions using Infrastructure as Code for B2B startups and growing businesses.

## How we help businesses succeed on AWS Cloud

AWS promises simplicity but delivers complexity. Businesses struggle with security risks and compliance requirements that divert developers from core product work.

Without AWS expertise, you face vulnerabilities, technical debt, and market delays while competitors race ahead.

Traditional consultancies worsen this by prioritizing billable hours over outcomes.

We take the opposite approach, focusing exclusively on business outcomes by eliminating AWS complexity, accelerating your developers, and securing your infrastructure through:

### Deploying a [Secure Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone)

  - **100% score** on [CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html)
  - **96% rating** on [AWS foundational security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html)
- Manage user access securely on AWS via Single Sign-On (SSO)

## What This Means For Your Business
- **30% Lower TCO**: Cut Total Cost by 40% through right-sized resources while eliminating the $150K+ cost of a specialized AWS hire.
