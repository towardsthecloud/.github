AWS starts simple. As you scale, technical debt compounds. Production and staging environments blur together. Resources multiply without clear ownership. IAM policies accumulate exceptions. Security findings pile up in backlogs. The AWS bill climbs month after month.

These are all symptoms of a missing AWS foundation. Without it, your developers spend more time fixing problems than shipping features that drive business growth.

**We solve this by providing that foundation and owning it entirely, so your team focuses on shipping, not firefighting.**

### Here's How We Do It

**1. We Provision a Secure [Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone) That Accelerates Compliance**
- Multi-account architecture with security controls and compliance guardrails from day one
- Achieve 100% on [CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html) and 96% on [AWS Foundational Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html)
- These benchmarks map directly to **SOC 2**, **HIPAA**, and **PCI-DSS** controls, cutting months from your compliance timeline

**2. We Monitor Proactively to Stop Cost Waste and Security Drift**
- Quarterly cost reviews identify unattached volumes, oversized instances, and orphaned resources. We clean up waste before it compounds, reducing your AWS spend by an average of 20-30%, with [occasional outliers of 60+%](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization#case-study).
- Continuous security monitoring across all accounts catches misconfigurations and policy violations immediately. You get alerts while issues are still fixable, not after they're breaches

**3. We Provide Senior AWS Expertise That Accelerates Delivery**
- Your developers get access to production-ready IaC templates for common patterns: multi-az applications, event-driven architectures, secure data pipelines. What typically takes weeks of research and iteration ships in hours
- Get solutions architecture guidance on VPC design, IAM policies, disaster recovery, observability and more. Your team makes faster decisions because we've already solved these problems for enterprises at scale
