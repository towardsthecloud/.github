Towards the Cloud is an AWS Cloud Consultancy delivering well-architected, resilient AWS solutions using Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK) for B2B startups and growing businesses.

## [Our story](https://towardsthecloud.com/about)

While AWS promises simplicity, I witnessed countless businesses struggle with overwhelming complexity, security risks, and compliance requirementsâ€”diverting valuable developer talent away from core product development.

Traditional consultancies exacerbate this problem by billing hourly, prioritizing billable time over business outcomes.

That's why I founded Towards the Cloud in 2023 with a fundamentally different approach: a [fixed-price subscription model](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing) that delivers an enterprise-grade AWS Landing Zone with ongoing expert support. We succeed when you succeed, aligning our incentives with your growth rather than your AWS complexity.

### Here's how we take out the complexity, speed up your development and secure your infrastructure:

#### We deploy a [Secure and Compliant Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone)
- Multi-account architecture with proper security boundaries
  - **Achieves a 100% score on the industry-standard [CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html)**
  - **Achieves a 96% rating on AWS's own [foundational security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html)**
- Setup entirely using AWS CDK (Infrastructure as Code)
- Budget monitoring and notifications across all accounts
- Deploy changes quickly through GitHub Actions
- We're continuously adding new features as listed on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/towardsthecloud/aws-cdk-landing-zone-roadmap)

#### We upskill and accelerate your Developers
- They gain access to our library of ready-to-use, security-hardened AWS CDK components
- They receive guidance on how to utilize AWS best practices for your architecture so you avoid technical debt later on

#### We monitor and maintain the multi-account setup & provide ongoing support
- Gain new Landing Zone features once they're released and get free maintenance and security updates
- Get priority support through Slack/Teams whenever you need assistance with infrastructure challenges
- We proactively do quarterly [security](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review) and [cost optimization](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) assessments to verify AWS account compliance and provide advice to reduce your AWS bill

#### What This Means For Your Business
- **30% Lower TCO**: Cut your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by up to 30% through right-sized resources and architectural optimization while eliminating the $150K+ annual cost of a specialized AWS hire
- **Close Enterprise Deals Faster**: Win enterprise clients with SOC2 compliance ready in weeks instead of months - our clients report 50% faster sales cycles with security-conscious customers
- **Unleash Your Development Team**: Redirect up to 30% of engineering time from infrastructure back to revenue-generating product features with our pre-built, compliant components
- **Scale Without Infrastructure Headaches**: Grow from startup to enterprise without ever rebuilding your foundation - our architecture scales seamlessly from your first customer to your millionth

We deliver all of this as a [simple subscription service](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing). No large upfront costs, no lock-in.
