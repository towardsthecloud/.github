## About us

[Towards the Cloud](https://towardsthecloud.com/about) is an AWS Cloud Consultancy delivering well-architected, resilient AWS solutions using Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK) for B2B startups and growing businesses.

## How we help businesses succeed on AWS Cloud

While AWS promises simplicity, we witnessed countless businesses struggle with overwhelming complexity, security risks, and compliance requirements, diverting valuable developer talent away from core product development.

Without specialized AWS expertise, you risk security vulnerabilities, mounting technical debt, and delayed time-to-market. All while your competitors race ahead.

Traditional consultancies exacerbate this problem by billing hourly, prioritizing billable time over business outcomes.

We take a fundamentally different approach by taking out the complexity on AWS, speed up your developers and secure your infrastructure on AWS by:

#### Deploying a [Secure and Compliant Landing Zone](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone)
- Multi-account architecture with proper security boundaries
  - Achieves a **100% score** on the industry-standard [CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html)
  - Achieves a **96% rating** on AWS's own [foundational security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html)
- Setup entirely using AWS CDK (Infrastructure as Code)
- Budget monitoring and notifications across all accounts
- Deploy changes quickly through GitHub Actions
- We're continuously adding new features as listed on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/towardsthecloud/aws-cdk-landing-zone-roadmap)

#### Upskilling and accelerating your Developers
- They gain access to our library of ready-to-use, security-hardened AWS CDK components
- They receive guidance on how to utilize AWS best practices for your architecture so you avoid technical debt later on

#### Monitoring and maintaining your multi-account AWS landing zone & providing ongoing support
- Gain new Landing Zone features once they're released and get free maintenance and security updates
- Get priority support through Slack/Teams whenever you need assistance with infrastructure challenges
- We proactively do quarterly [security](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review) and [cost optimization](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) assessments to verify AWS account compliance and provide advice to reduce your AWS bill

### What This Means For Your Business
- **30% Lower TCO**: Cut your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by up to 30% through right-sized resources and architectural optimization while eliminating the $150K+ annual cost of a specialized AWS hire
- **Close Enterprise Deals Faster**: Win enterprise clients with SOC2 compliance ready in weeks instead of months - our clients report 50% faster sales cycles with security-conscious customers
- **Unleash Your Development Team**: Redirect up to 30% of engineering time from infrastructure back to revenue-generating product features with our pre-built, compliant components
- **Scale Without Infrastructure Headaches**: Grow from startup to enterprise without ever rebuilding your foundation - our architecture scales seamlessly from your first customer to your millionth

We deliver all of this as a [simple subscription service](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing). No large upfront costs, no lock-in.
